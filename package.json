  "description": "Given a list of integers, create a function that returns the nth-rarest item. The function, should be called nth_most_rate signature and its signature nth_most_rate signature(list,n) where list is the array of integers and n is the nth rarest term. For example in [5,4,5,4, 5,4,4,5,3,3,3,2,2, 1,5], if 2 is supplied as n, the answer is 2 as 2 is the 2nd rarest item.",
